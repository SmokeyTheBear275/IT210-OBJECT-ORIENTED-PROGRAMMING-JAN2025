[Intro]
Just for the record, let's get the story straight
Me and Uncle Tom were fishin', it was gettin' pretty late
Out on a cypress limb above the wishin' well
Where the sea ain't got no bottom, say it take you down to hell

[Verse 1]
Over in the bushes and off to the right
Come two men talkin' in the pale moonlight
Sheriff John Brady and Deputy Hess
Haulin' two limp bodies down to the water's edge

[Chorus]
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin, oh, yeah
I know a secret that I just can't tell

[Verse 2]
They didn't see me and Tom in the tree
Neither one believin' what the other could see
Tossed in the bodies, let 'em sink on down
To the bottom of the well where they'd never be found

[Chorus]
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin, oh, yeah
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
Know who put the bodies in the wishin' well

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Soon as they were gone, me and Tom got down
Prayin' real hard that we wouldn't make a sound
Runnin' through the woods back to Uncle Tom's shack
Where the full moon shines through the rooftop cracks

[Verse 3]
"Oh my God, Tom, who are we gonna tell?
The sheriff, he belongs in a prison cell"
"Keep your mouth shut, that's what we're gonna do
Unless you wanna wind up in the wishing well, too"

[Chorus]
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin, ooh, yeah, yeah
I know a secret that I just can't tell
Oh, I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin

[Outro]
Know who put the bodies, know who put the bodies
In the wishin' well, oh, yeah
